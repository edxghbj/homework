    <b>2. write a bref history of JavaScript that covers all version up to ECMA6</b>
    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

        It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
        
        After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop 
        JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
        Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1). <br>
